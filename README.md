# React lesson
This is a lesson about React.js. It helps to get started with:
* React basics
* Styling of React components
* React-Router (v4)
* MobX

To get started, first install all dependencies:
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm install -g reveal-md
```

To run the presentation, type:
```bash
$ reveal-md slides.md
```

To generate a PDF version of the slides, type:
```bash
$ reveal-md slides.md --print slides.pdf
```
or directly append `?print-pdf` to the browsers URL (don't forget to remove slide numbers like #/1 eg.). Then execute the print command in your browser.
