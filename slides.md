## About React

Note: (about 45 to 60 minutes)

### What is React?
----
Note: 
Just a SIMPLE view library
No router, no state management, no HTTP client etc  (keeps it small, no framework)
Difference compared to Angular etc.
---

### Basic principles of React
----
#### JSX
----
Looks like: HTML with Javascript 
Is: Javascript used for templates
How to use?

----
#### Components
----
What are components? Encapsulated, independent
can be nested to each other
----
Example: Page, separated in single components
---

### How to render a component
React DOM
Static vs stateful components
Props 
for getting information from parent components
Prop Types
Passing props
Children
 State
 state stays internal
Default state, Accessing, mutating state
Example that shows how state + props work (DEMO)
Unidirectional data flow (sharing state between components)
Moving state up in the components tree
Event handlers
---

### React lifecycle methods
Use cases for every method
---

### React Example application consuming a API (DEMO)
Show props and state changes in React developer tools
---

### Advantages of React:
Small / Simple / Modular
Very comfortable JSX syntax (supporting full JS usage)
No custom keywords required like *ngFor, *ngIf, pipes | v-if, v-for, just plain JS!
Virtual DOM 
What and why?
Universal Javascript (one codebase for all)
allows server side rendering
doesn’t require client to enable JS

PART 3: FLUX (about 30 minutes) —> talk + discussions (OPTIONAL)

Problem: sharing state between components

What is FLUX?
Maintaining application state
Just a pattern, no library

Store
Actions
Dispatchers

Example using Redux
